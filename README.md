# near-triumphs

A tool for generating variations on Inspectah Deck's verse in Triumph. [Here are the generated verses.](https://jimkang.com/near-triumphs). This created my [NaPoGenMo](https://github.com/NaPoGenMo/NaPoGenMo2021) entry.

Warning: This is was implemented via a wretched and cursed hack. It uses this [slant rhyme module](https://github.com/jimkang/rime/), but I didn't actually want to run the build for that, so this tool shells out to the [Docker image](https://github.com/jimkang/rime-docker-image/) repeatedly.
